Added support for version based optimistic locking.
- New annotation net.java.ao.Version is used for enabling this feature per entity.
- The version is initialized for a newly created entity [EntityManager.create()].
- The version is incremented with every save [EntityProxy.save()].  A version check is 
  performed to detect concurrent modifications.
- Enhanced EntityManager.find() so that it will not return objects whose version is
  set to the intial value.
